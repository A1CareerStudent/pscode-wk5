// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Declare and enter the Number'N': N=10
If the Number is divisible by 2 and the remainder is 0 (10%2==0) then
Print Even
Else
Print Odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Enter 5 numbers: n1-n5
Read 5 separate numbers: n1,n2,n3,n4,n5
Set sum = n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5
Set average = sum / 5
Display the average number
If n1 > n2:
Set min to n2
Else:
Set min to n1
If n3 < min:
Set min to n3
If n4 < min:
Set min to n4
If n5 < min:
Set min to n5
Display the minimum number
If n1 < n2:
Set max to n2
Else:
Set max to n1
If n3 > max:
Set max to n3
If n4 > max:
Set max to n4
If n5 > max:
Set max to n5
Display the maximum number
